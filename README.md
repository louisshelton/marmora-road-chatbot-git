beautiful data project

For this project I initially wanted to make something that removed or erased rather than created because normally that what we use pen plotters for and the project is about using it differently, however, whilst looking for data sets that I could use I started thinking about how data can be ignored and I started thinking about ufos. Ufos are always looked at as myths or fake news but there is crazy amounts different sightings reported everyday, most people you talk to have a different ufo story they can tell you about. So the question is why do we choose to ignore this data? To represent the amount of data we have about ufos I decided to use the pen plotter to make crop circles in a fake miniature field, I wanted to use the field to represent the size of the data collected. The code filters through the CSV and collects random occurrences recorded, and gives a sum of the amount of occurrences that year, it then uses axe draw to move a soldering iron through the field that burns a circle that is bigger or smaller depending on how many occurrences, unfortunately I couldnâ€™t try this out because using a soldering iron to burn through my fake crop field would cause to much smoke to be used inside of the campus, instead I have a video demonstrating the pen plotter making the circles and an example crop field that would have been created by the pen plotter if I could have used it.
